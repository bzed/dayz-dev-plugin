# Print N random ports (default 3) for a DayZ test server: game, Steam query, RCon.
#
# Each port is free for both UDP and TCP right now, is not a DayZ/Steam default
# (2302-2306, 27015-27016), and is at least 10 away from the others, because the server
# also uses ports next to the game port.
#
# Usage: free-ports.sh [N]      e.g.  set -- $(free-ports.sh 3); GAME=$1 QUERY=$2 RCON=$3
