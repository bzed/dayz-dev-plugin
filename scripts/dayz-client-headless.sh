# Only ONE game runs at a time: `start` refuses while any DayZ client is running (even the
# user's own). Servers are different: run as many as you like, each on its own tree and ports.
# Stop the game as soon as the test is over; it holds the GPU, ~10 GB of RAM and the Steam account.
#
# Steam must be running (the game talks to the Steam client). `steam -applaunch` is NOT used: it
# hands the launch to the running Steam, which would open the window on your real desktop. This
# runs the same chain Steam does (Steam Linux Runtime -> Proton -> DayZ_x64.exe) from inside the
# headless session, so the game inherits that session's WAYLAND_DISPLAY/DISPLAY.
#
# Needs: sway (wlroots), grim, a Steam install of DayZ (221100) with a Proton tool selected.
# Environment: STEAM_ROOT (default ~/.steam/debian-installation), PROTON (name of the Proton tool,
# default GE-Proton11-1; the tool Steam selected for 221100 is not read), RES (default 1280x720).
# Mod folders (@name) must exist in the DayZ install dir; symlinks to workshop items are fine.
